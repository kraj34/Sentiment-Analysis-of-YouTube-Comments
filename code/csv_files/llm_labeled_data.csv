"I listen to and love many different genres and time periods. Don't completely shun or disregard music just because it's popular or mainstream. I remember the first time I heard rolling in the deep and loved it instantly. Her voice is incredible. Usually I don't listen to much mainstream pop but am no longer embarrassed to admit I like a song. This and her breakout hit are my favorite. Amazing, powerful voice. Emotions that are brought up are relatable. One of my favorite things about her is that there is no denying her talent even though she doesn't look like Beyonce.

"It is reserved to men once to die, and after this, Judgment.
Hebrews 9:27 LITV

But God commends His love to us in this, that we being yet sinners, Christ died for us. 
Romans 5:8 LITV

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone believing into Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 
John 3:16 LITV

Repent and be baptized, each of you on the name of Jesus Christ to remission of sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
Acts 2:38 LITV

Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, If one is not generated out of water and Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God. 
John 3:5 LITV

For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 
Romans 8:14 LITV

The one believing into the Son has everlasting life; but the one disobeying the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. 
John 3:36 LITV

Do not be deceived, God is not mocked. For whatever a man may sow, that he also will reap. 
Galatians 6:7 LITV

For if we are willfully sinning after receiving the full knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice concerning sins,
Hebrews 10:26 LITV

Go in through the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are the ones entering in through it. For narrow is the gate, and constricted is the way that leads away into life, and few are the ones finding it. 
Matthew 7:13-14 LITV

Eye has not seen, and ear has not heard,"" nor has it risen up into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those that love Him.

My psych therapist broke me down to the absolute core in a deep group session, with this song... And other exacting skills.

"Nice. Leah, my beloved, lingers in my thoughts, her absence palpable. My love for her transcends life, enduring eternally. Greetings from the beyond, where time ebbs and tears flow. In breathless moments, I yearn for her presence. Sometimes, the government, blind to our worth, shuns us as expensive commodities. Yet, our bond defies their assessment. We are more than mere mud; we are souls intertwined. Despite societal indifference, our love remains steadfast, a testament to its enduring strength and resilience, defying all odds, thriving beyond the constraints of earthly judgment.",positive

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows)

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

"To anyone out there who has gone through the pain a divorce and then realizing that you made a mistake. You do a ton of soul searching, and ask yourself, what you did wrong to let it come to this? You just made a mistake so many others make. But there is hope for you. This song helped me put it all into perspective. No other piece of music has ever done that. It lifted me up out of the dumps I was in for the longest. I tryed making amends with my ex and this song invoked everything I was feeling during those painful times. It emulated my feelings at the time. I just didn't want to talk to anyone after that, but this song suddenly took me to that one place, where it was just quiet. Adele is pure beauty in so many ways.",positive

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?

"Thank you Adele for creating this monumental work, no matter how many years go by it is impossible to forget it. Your song moved me so much to make me cry, it also inspired me to create a story: Hello, it's me.
I was hoping to talk to you again.
Nothing is the same as before, I don't think we can change anything.
Still, I remember the good times we had. Hello? Are you still there? I don't need to tell you how important you were to me, I don't need to tell you what you mean to me. I thought we could go far and be something more but I was wrong, they call it innocence. Hello, I'm here, in this darkness consuming my soul, even if you don't believe it, I'll keep waiting for you. Hello, how are you? It's hard to answer that question after what happened between us. I'm not sure if it's regret, but I still feel things for you. Everything is very complicated, it's impossible to move forward, every day I remember you, it's impossible to forget you. What did you do to me? Hello cursed distance, what was it that drove us apart? Was it my fault or was it fate? I still remember the good times we had. What was it that robbed us of happiness? Hello cruel world, what did we do to deserve this punishment? Perhaps it was our ego that led us to wickedness? God didn't want this for us, we didn't seek it out, we should have done things right. I don't know what else to tell you, I feel really bad right now, I feel like everything is breaking inside me, I'm suffocating. I've forgotten how to breathe, I wish I could burn like a sardine right now, I wish I could explode into a thousand pieces and everyone would forget about me. Do you remember when I wrote to you, your hair is infernal fire: embers of January: there I burn. Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming of who we used to be, when we were younger and free. From so much arrogance and selfishness, I forgot how it felt to feel before the world fell at our feet. Do you remember when destiny mocked us, do you remember when the world ignored us? I hope you're well, there's so much difference between us. Hello from the other side, I should've called you a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry for everything I've done, but when I call it seems like you're never home. Hello from the outside, at least I can say that I've tried, to tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart. Why apologize when I've already hurt you so much, I hope you can forgive me and if not, I hope you're happy and move on. You probably forgot about me, you'll remember me as something unpleasant and toxic. But I can't forget you, it's impossible, you're like a witch's dagger, you stabbed into my heart and destroyed everything. You were like Ghostface's knife when he stabbed Sidney in Scream. There's only a damn emptiness left, a void that's impossible to fill. I remember what Bella said in Twilight: love is irrational, the more you love someone the less sense everything makes. So why do I love you if love is stupid? Bella also suffered a lot for Edward, I think I'm feeling the same as her. The whole world is falling apart, my insides are twisting, it's like there's a monster inside me. Hello, you've probably stopped reading this nonsense, I hope you're well, it's so typical to talk about myself, I'm sorry. Did you ever manage to get out of this damn city? I didn't. No, I stayed here unfortunately, I stayed anchored in the past, the past that hurt me so much, the past that completely ruined my life. That's why I'm so bad, that's why I can't forget anything, that's why I don't trust anyone anymore. You're probably better off than me, you've probably moved on and are happy, enjoy that happiness thinking of me, I don't think we'll ever see each other again. In the end, they were right about love not always being what it seems, love mocked me, it was just a mirage to hurt me. At first, I thought it was a dream, that it was something sincere and special. I think love was the lake where we first met, the lake that tried to drown me and end my life. I don't have the strength to keep talking to you, I feel weak, I feel like it's the end, I'll always remember the special moments we lived, the life we shared together, I feel tears coming out of my eyes, now I have to embark on a new path, I hope to find happiness just like you. Goodbye Kris, I will always love you even though the light has gone out and there is only darkness. ❤❤️‍🔥🥺",negative

It’s 2024 & I just want my teenage love from 1-29-06 to know that I still think about him from time to time 😞 I won’t ever have love like he loved me and it’s so sad that he moved to Austin when we were 14 😭 but I’m grateful for the experience I had with him as a teenager💕 I hope he reads this one day bc he knows who he is 💞,positive
"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)

"Don't know if this will make sense, but this song makes me reflect so much on my past, I was diagnosed with ADHD last year, and it turns out it has been the cause of so much painful moments, and phases in my life,  this makes me think about an hypothetical reality were I could call myself in the past and tell my past self that I'm sorry for not trying harder to look for answers back then, but at the same time, I know its time to move on now, and the ""what was"" is unchangeable, but the ""what is and what will be"" is up to me and the knowledge I gained through experience. This song speaks to me this way, makes me emotional, but in a useful way *shrugs*.
Its my case, but I believe it can be made for anyone for every life experience

But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

"ANGEL IN BLACK

Elegance,
passion,
art,
His voice rises to infinity and explodes:
the whole world admires her,
he adores her,
It is God who has sent us his majestic angel,
angel with a sweet and powerful voice.

He dresses in black,
she dresses in triumph,
She is dressed in immense love.

Everything is perfect in her,
everything combines:
her steps,
her gestures,
high and low tones,
the piano,
The chorus,
the violin,
Guitar,
and the wonderful effects in each presentation.

Her earrings and Saturn tattoo
They contain her musical force.
Angelo is the blessed name,
sacred tattoo on her right hand,
It is her divine love,
It is her eternal love.


She is unique in humility,
she is unique in interpretation:
heartache,
Sorrow of the soul,
pain and hope,
pain and dignity,
It is a cry that cries;
that she screams into space,
that claims,
who asks for forgiveness, but she also forgives...
and with the memories of deceptions and betrayals,
she also dances
she laughs too,
She interacts with the public respectful of her,
and everyone is now chanting and enjoying with elegance and rhythm.

This is Adele,
angel dressed in black,
glare,
childish and divine smile,
God's angel,
everyone's angel...
Adele, you are the heavenly gift to the universe,
Adele, long life and happiness in every step.

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)

like a self-induced abortion in a solitary room that booms with the mind-bending agony of this tortuous melody 
that makes a rush of serotonin happen like a search and rescue mission that exceeds the triage capacity of a million clinics
gospel truth that absolutely obliterates the senses - a ray of hope being snuffed out due to an unforeseen snapshot of what could have been had a trick question not cut the kite string of my hopes causing me to plumet from the summit with no bottom in sight as I continue falling faster into life-cancelling night",negative

Metals shall be your Valor.
Stars in the sky shall flower.

WAR cries, your body dies.

WAR dies, severed ties.

It's all such a truth.
An eye for an eye.

"O my people, I do not ask you for money. My reward is only from God, and I will not drive away those who believe. Indeed, they will meet their Lord. But I see that you are an ignorant people.
And the mountains are pegs
The Sunnah of God is among those who passed away before, and you will not find any change in the Sunnah of God
O We sent before you among the messengers, except that they ate food and walked in the markets, and We made some of you a test for one another. Will you be patient? And your Lord is ever Seeing.
Say, “Call upon God” or “Call upon the Most Merciful.” Whatever you call upon, to Him belong the most beautiful names. And do not recite your prayers loudly, nor be silent in them, but seek a way between these.",positive

I just read a story I guess an interview where she says this is a song about a call to her past. Now the first verse sounds like it could be but moving on it's pretty clear she wouldn't be telling herself sorry for breaking her own heart. or saying she is well to herself. Why would she ask herself if she ever got out of that town. This is clearly about someone in her history.,neutral

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

hello it's me
After all, I've been thinking about this for the past few years.
I wish I could overcome everything and meet you
They say time heals everything.
I'm not fully healed yet

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm still dreaming of the old days in California
When we were both young and free
I forgot how she felt before she took off.
We're already too different
Because we're so far apart

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, call out from the other side
I'm sure I've called you a thousand times already.
To tell you that I'm sorry for everything
Hello, I call you from outside
At least I can say I tried.
To tell you that I'm sorry for disappointing you
But that's enough, I'm not going to upset you anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret
That the both of us are running out of time

Hello, how are you doing?
This is just me talking about myself, sorry.
I hope you're doing well
Have you left that town yet?
From that town where nothing happens
That's completely understandable.
'Cause we don't have any time left

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore

Hello, call out from the other side

When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet, to go over
Everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret
That the both of us are running out of time

So, hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart

"Can relate to entire music video, I met her when we were in elementary school, early 80s. Over the years we wondered about the other. 32 years later we met up, she at time married. Eventually she divorced and strung me along. She met another and took up with him and wanted us to remain friends. I couldn’t do it any longer. So I understand the guy in the video going from ecstatic, happy to bitter about it all and just walked away. Back of my mind always wished that phone call from her, hello.",negative

"I'm not really an Adele fan and I've never been interested in listening to any of her songs. But that cover about the flat earth piqued my interest.

The greatest compliment I can pay this song is that I kind of dislike Adele. I don't know why this amalgamation of various relationships failed but it was definitely her fault, she should definitely feel bad about it and I understand why she would want to run away from what she did. Whatever she did was bad.

I have a similar song I'm working on, but I'm a thousand times the bad person she is in this song. I can only hope to get across this level of emotion from my bad deeds in a rap, but I know I have to or the song won't work.",negative

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

"🏛Ephesians 5:1 to 8. BE therefore imitators of God, as 👩‍❤‍👩beloved 👨‍👨‍👧‍👧children; 2 And walk in 💛love, as Christ also loved💞💚 you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma. 3 But fornication, and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you , as befits saints; 4 Neither turpitude, nor foolishness, nor jesting, which are not convenient; but first, thanksgiving. 5 For this you know, that no sexually immoral or immoral person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.😨😭 6 Let no one deceive you with empty words; because for these things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience. 7 Therefore, do not be his companions. 8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the LORD; walk as children of light.",positive

"Lyrics in Latin:

Nose to you:
After so many years I doubted - do you remember me?
I was reading by the mouth of the people
They say time heals everything
But I saw nothing

 

I write - do you read?
I turned to Pontus, dreaming, alas, what life was for me
When I was poor in Rome
I forget the bright life before, ah, the misery
Oh, how far you are from me
And my status

 

[chorus]

Greetings from Ovid
I live in poor Thomas
Repentance of all affections
But with you there is never mercy

 

Hello from exile
Alas, I have lost my wits
And if I could I would not have erred in you
But now it does not matter, I am cast down from hope.

 

Hello, Auguste
I always talk about myself, please forgive me
I hope you are well
What has become difficult with that daughter?
It is clear that we are both miserable
must be

 

[chorus]

Now greetings from Ovid
I live in poor Thomas
Repentance of all affections
But with you there is never mercy

 

Hello from exile
And they die' Ovid
And if I had been able I would have written nothing to Hercules
But I was condemned by the poem and by the mistake

 

Ooooohh, mistake
Ooooohh, mistake
Ooooohh, mistake
By mistake

 

Greetings from Ovid
I live in poor Thomas
Repentance of all affections
But with you there is never mercy

 

Hello from exile
Alas, I have lost my wits
And if I could I would not have erred in you
But now it does not matter, I am cast down from hope.",negative

"Adele's 'Hello' music video is a cinematic masterpiece that complements the haunting beauty of the song. The sepia-toned visuals and Adele's emotive performance create a poignant narrative of heartbreak and longing. The attention to detail in every frame, coupled with Adele's soul-stirring voice, evokes a deep sense of nostalgia and raw emotion. 'Hello' not only resonates as a powerful ballad but also as a visual storytelling experience that lingers in the heart, leaving an indelible mark on the viewer's soul",positive

"You know this is Adele's biggest song when it's the only one that played in my country at my childhood. But does it deserve as much love as it gets? I mean, I don't know. I'm debating whether this or Send my Love is better. Probably Send my Love. It's catchier and has a good misheard lyric. But this is better than I remember, for sure. The last chorus uses real drums, it seems, which is great, I like that a lot. A lot better than ""Rolling in the Deep"", there's no denial about that.",positive

Adele has an almost uncanny understanding of music and the gradual building up to the song's climax where she puts her vocal prowess on full display. She is a master of her beautiful craft and easily one of the best artists of all time. A living legend that has gifted the world numerous masterpieces that will still be enjoyed hundreds of years from now and those of us who were alive during the years of this ultra talented young woman are aware how fortunate we are to bear witness to true greatness.,positive

"OMG Adele is soooo amazing! I love her and her talent. Omg such masterpieces of songs! What beautiful, sad, inspiring music! Omg she is just best! Her music moves me in ways I can't explain! Adele iz such an inspiration! I feel better after crying over my abusive ex. She makes me understand I'm better than that! My ex sucks and if he ever touches me again, I'll make his cockadoodledoo bleed! Thank you, Adele, you are my one true love! I will find you and marry you, my talented butterfly! I'm sorry I'm writing so much, I have insomnia and get a bit gitty and pumped up, especially to ADELE'S gracious music. Love it, love it, love it! Omg her songs hit me metaphorically to how my ex's crippled self  hit me - only like in an opposite like way. He's a little short Mexican man that spreaded lies and lied about lying, lying that he lied a lie and continued to lie, lying like  the piece of 🟤 he is. He (almost) devoured anything good and worthy I have inside myself! He dwelled feelings in me like ugliness, powerlessness, unholy convictions, yielding a broken, careless, angry, guilty, bitter, disgusted little girl. I broke the patterns of forgiving and not forgetting, unemotional sex, ""good"" times and replaced them with just ME in moving along, healthy times and peace without any conflict. Omg love Adele and her ability to soothe my heart! PS, my adoptive Mom does the same and no longer speaks to me:(. Another birthday and holiday alone. Omg 😮. At least I have Adele and other people who sing songs.",positive

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

"DEC 1ST 
A HIGHER PLAIN
SCRIPTURE READING: 
MARK 14:51-52 
51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: 52 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. 

MARK 16:5-6 
5 When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a long white robe sitting on the right side; they were amazed and alarmed. 6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.

TITLE:  (SHOCKED BY HONOR)
                DON’T BE ALARMED!
HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIDE!

A anonymous young man couldn’t take the adversity that was gifted to him by following Jesus.
He fled leaving behind his garment.

At the resurrection of Jesus we find the same young man clothed in white linen.
Symbolic of purity the white linen represents the honor of overcoming.

A  juvenile overcomes adolescence when he gives honor.

He in the tomb allowed another to go ahead of him.
Jesus went on but he stayed.

Beloved they where shocked when they seen the young man in the tomb proclaiming 
‘It’s juvenile for you to seek the memory of death when the resurrection should be honored.

Can you hear the honor from what once was juvenile say
‘Jesus is not here, He’s moved on to maturity?

Jesus loves you so do I.

Your about to be SHOCKED BY HONOR!

DON’T BE ALARMED!
IT IS RESURRECTION LIFE!",positive

"Hi ADELE. Nice to meet you. I put your name in big letters. Because you are great as a singer, as a nice, friendly person, etc. First time I'm watching your Mix and videos on You Tube. I've always liked you. You have a very beautiful voice. And he sings very well. I watched and still watch Madonna's songs. And now I will always follow you on You Tube. The Madonna is more of a pop singer. And he sings a lot too. I watched Mix a lot and her videos too. You are younger. But she still sings a lot. I also really liked DANASAMER. It was wonderful, but it was mediocre, right? But he had a spectacular voice. I liked watching it and I still watch it sometimes. MADONNA videos. I just didn't like one thing after learning how to translate conversations in Portuguese these days. And YouTube doesn't translate your songs into Portuguese. I think it's all of them, I don't know why. Then I'll listen to MADONNA's songs to see if it's like that too. Or just with yours. KISSES, LOVE. 💋💋💋💋❤️❤️ Two hearts, mine and yours. 🌹🌹🌹🌹🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️👍✌️🇧🇷🇺🇸.",positive
"My first wife died of a drug overdose right around the time this song came out, we’d been long divorced for at least fifteen years, was a bad divorce and a pretty toxic relationship to say the least, and after the years  and dust had settled, was glad to be over it, but the day I found out, of her passing, this song was playing on the radio while I was working, hadn’t shed a tear for her in probably over 20 years, but that day this song did it (maybe a small message from her from all those years ago, or maybe just a coincidence) either way the timing for that song and lyrics were moving.

"[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)

Here's hoping that Adele graces us with another surprise release this year, stirring up the same excitement and breaking the internet once again. The world can certainly use more of her incredible talent and emotive storytelling. Fingers crossed for another unforgettable musical experience! 🎶✨",positive

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows)

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

"Love Adele's voice and the song is beautiful sounding, but the lyrics and message are awful. The woman in the song is upset because she left some guy for her career and is now having regrets. But she ends up blaming the man for having moved on.
