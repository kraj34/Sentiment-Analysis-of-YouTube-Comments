Your song moved me so much to make me cry, it also inspired me to create a story: Hello, it's me.\\nI was hoping to talk to you again.\\nNothing is the same as before, I don't think we can change anything.\\nStill, I remember the good times we had. Hello? Are you still there? I don't need to tell you how important you were to me, I don't need to tell you what you mean to me. I thought we could go far and be something more but I was wrong, they call it innocence. Hello, I'm here, in this darkness consuming my soul, even if you don't believe it, I'll keep waiting for you. Hello, how are you? It's hard to answer that question after what happened between us. I'm not sure if it's regret, but I still feel things for you. Everything is very complicated, it's impossible to move forward, every day I remember you, it's impossible to forget you. What did you do to me? Hello cursed distance, what was it that drove us apart? Was it my fault or was it fate? I still remember the good times we had. What was it that robbed us of happiness? Hello cruel world, what did we do to deserve this punishment? Perhaps it was our ego that led us to wickedness? God didn't want this for us, we didn't seek it out, we should have done things right. I don't know what else to tell you, I feel really bad right now, I feel like everything is breaking inside me, I'm suffocating. I've forgotten how to breathe, I wish I could burn like a sardine right now, I wish I could explode into a thousand pieces and everyone would forget about me. Do you remember when I wrote to you, your hair is infernal fire: embers of January: there I burn. Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming of who we used to be, when we were younger and free. From so much arrogance and selfishness, I forgot how it felt to feel before the world fell at our feet. Do you remember when destiny mocked us, do you remember when the world ignored us? I hope you're well, there's so much difference between us. Hello from the other side, I should've called you a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry for everything I've done, but when I call it seems like you're never home. Hello from the outside, at least I can say that I've tried, to tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart. Why apologize when I've already hurt you so much, I hope you can forgive me and if not, I hope you're happy and move on. You probably forgot about me, you'll remember me as something unpleasant and toxic. But I can't forget you, it's impossible, you're like a witch's dagger, you stabbed into my heart and destroyed everything. You were like Ghostface's knife when he stabbed Sidney in Scream. There's only a damn emptiness left, a void that's impossible to fill. I remember what Bella said in Twilight: love is irrational, the more you love someone the less sense everything makes. So why do I love you if love is stupid? Bella also suffered a lot for Edward, I think I'm feeling the same as her. The whole world is falling apart, my insides are twisting, it's like there's a monster inside me. Hello, you've probably stopped reading this nonsense, I hope you're well, it's so typical to talk about myself, I'm sorry. Did you ever manage to get out of this damn city? I didn't. No, I stayed here unfortunately, I stayed anchored in the past, the past that hurt me so much, the past that completely ruined my life. That's why I'm so bad, that's why I can't forget anything, that's why I don't trust anyone anymore. You're probably better off than me, you've probably moved on and are happy, enjoy that happiness thinking of me, I don't think we'll ever see each other again. In the end, they were right about love not always being what it seems, love mocked me, it was just a mirage to hurt me. At first, I thought it was a dream, that it was something sincere and special. I think love was the lake where we first met, the lake that tried to drown me and end my life. I don't have the strength to keep talking to you, I feel weak, I feel like it's the end, I'll always remember the special moments we lived, the life we shared together, I feel tears coming out of my eyes, now I have to embark on a new path, I hope to find happiness just like you.

You have a very beautiful voice. And he sings very well. I watched and still watch Madonna's songs. And now I will always follow you on You Tube. The Madonna is more of a pop singer. And he sings a lot too. I watched Mix a lot and her videos too. You are younger. But she still sings a lot. I also really liked DANASAMER. It was wonderful, but it was mediocre, right? But he had a spectacular voice. I liked watching it and I still watch it sometimes. MADONNA videos. I just didn't like one thing after learning how to translate conversations in Portuguese these days. And YouTube doesn't translate your songs into Portuguese. I think it's all of them, I don't know why. Then I'll listen to MADONNA's songs to see if it's like that too. Or just with yours.

Your song moved me so much to make me cry, it also inspired me to create a story: Hello, it's me.\\nI was hoping to talk to you again.\\nNothing is the same as before, I don't think we can change anything.\\nStill, I remember the good times we had. Hello? Are you still there? I don't need to tell you how important you were to me, I don't need to tell you what you mean to me. I thought we could go far and be something more but I was wrong, they call it innocence. Hello, I'm here, in this darkness consuming my soul, even if you don't believe it, I'll keep waiting for you. Hello, how are you? It's hard to answer that question after what happened between us. I'm not sure if it's regret, but I still feel things for you. Everything is very complicated, it's impossible to move forward, every day I remember you, it's impossible to forget you. What did you do to me? Hello cursed distance, what was it that drove us apart? Was it my fault or was it fate? I still remember the good times we had. What was it that robbed us of happiness? Hello cruel world, what did we do to deserve this punishment? Perhaps it was our ego that led us to wickedness? God didn't want this for us, we didn't seek it out, we should have done things right. I don't know what else to tell you, I feel really bad right now, I feel like everything is breaking inside me, I'm suffocating. I've forgotten how to breathe, I wish I could burn like a sardine right now, I wish I could explode into a thousand pieces and everyone would forget about me. Do you remember when I wrote to you, your hair is infernal fire: embers of January: there I burn. Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming of who we used to be, when we were younger and free. From so much arrogance and selfishness, I forgot how it felt to feel before the world fell at our feet. Do you remember when destiny mocked us, do you remember when the world ignored us? I hope you're well, there's so much difference between us. Hello from the other side, I should've called you a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry for everything I've done, but when I call it seems like you're never home. Hello from the outside, at least I can say that I've tried, to tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart. Why apologize when I've already hurt you so much, I hope you can forgive me and if not, I hope you're happy and move on. You probably forgot about me, you'll remember me as something unpleasant and toxic. But I can't forget you, it's impossible, you're like a witch's dagger, you stabbed into my heart and destroyed everything. You were like Ghostface's knife when he stabbed Sidney in Scream. There's only a damn emptiness left, a void that's impossible to fill. I remember what Bella said in Twilight: love is irrational, the more you love someone the less sense everything makes. So why do I love you if love is stupid? Bella also suffered a lot for Edward, I think I'm feeling the same as her. The whole world is falling apart, my insides are twisting, it's like there's a monster inside me. Hello, you've probably stopped reading this nonsense, I hope you're well, it's so typical to talk about myself, I'm sorry. Did you ever manage to get out of this damn city? I didn't. No, I stayed here unfortunately, I stayed anchored in the past, the past that hurt me so much, the past that completely ruined my life. That's why I'm so bad, that's why I can't forget anything, that's why I don't trust anyone anymore. You're probably better off than me, you've probably moved on and are happy, enjoy that happiness thinking of me, I don't think we'll ever see each other again. In the end, they were right about love not always being what it seems, love mocked me, it was just a mirage to hurt me. At first, I thought it was a dream, that it was something sincere and special. I think love was the lake where we first met, the lake that tried to drown me and end my life. I don't have the strength to keep talking to you, I feel weak, I feel like it's the end, I'll always remember the special moments we lived, the life we shared together, I feel tears coming out of my eyes, now I have to embark on a new path, I hope to find happiness just like you. Goodbye Kris, I will always love you even though the light has gone out and there is only darkness. ❤❤️\\u200d🔥🥺\", 'This songs have and will remain my best 💖.

And he sings a lot too. I watched Mix a lot and her videos too. You are younger. But she still sings a lot. I also really liked DANASAMER. It was wonderful, but it was mediocre, right? But he had a spectacular voice. I liked watching it and I still watch it sometimes. MADONNA videos. I just didn't like one thing after learning how to translate conversations in Portuguese these days. And YouTube doesn't translate your songs into Portuguese. I think it's all of them, I don't know why. Then I'll listen to MADONNA's songs to see if it's like that too. Or just with yours.
