"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)

"LYRICS🎤

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows)

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

But when I call, you never seem to be home

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well

Are running out of time

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if, after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?6
 
[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)

"Thank you Adele for creating this monumental work, no matter how many years go by it is impossible to forget it. Your song moved me so much to make me cry, it also inspired me to create a story: Hello, it's me.
I was hoping to talk to you again.
Nothing is the same as before, I don't think we can change anything.
Still, I remember the good times we had. Hello? Are you still there? I don't need to tell you how important you were to me, I don't need to tell you what you mean to me. I thought we could go far and be something more but I was wrong, they call it innocence. Hello, I'm here, in this darkness consuming my soul, even if you don't believe it, I'll keep waiting for you. Hello, how are you? It's hard to answer that question after what happened between us. I'm not sure if it's regret, but I still feel things for you. Everything is very complicated, it's impossible to move forward, every day I remember you, it's impossible to forget you. What did you do to me? Hello cursed distance, what was it that drove us apart? Was it my fault or was it fate? I still remember the good times we had. What was it that robbed us of happiness? Hello cruel world, what did we do to deserve this punishment? Perhaps it was our ego that led us to wickedness? God didn't want this for us, we didn't seek it out, we should have done things right. I don't know what else to tell you, I feel really bad right now, I feel like everything is breaking inside me, I'm suffocating. I've forgotten how to breathe, I wish I could burn like a sardine right now, I wish I could explode into a thousand pieces and everyone would forget about me. Do you remember when I wrote to you, your hair is infernal fire: embers of January: there I burn. Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming of who we used to be, when we were younger and free. From so much arrogance and selfishness, I forgot how it felt to feel before the world fell at our feet. Do you remember when destiny mocked us, do you remember when the world ignored us? I hope you're well, there's so much difference between us. Hello from the other side, I should've called you a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry for everything I've done, but when I call it seems like you're never home. Hello from the outside, at least I can say that I've tried, to tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart. Why apologize when I've already hurt you so much, I hope you can forgive me and if not, I hope you're happy and move on. You probably forgot about me, you'll remember me as something unpleasant and toxic. But I can't forget you, it's impossible, you're like a witch's dagger, you stabbed into my heart and destroyed everything. You were like Ghostface's knife when he stabbed Sidney in Scream. There's only a damn emptiness left, a void that's impossible to fill. I remember what Bella said in Twilight: love is irrational, the more you love someone the less sense everything makes. So why do I love you if love is stupid? Bella also suffered a lot for Edward, I think I'm feeling the same as her. The whole world is falling apart, my insides are twisting, it's like there's a monster inside me. Hello, you've probably stopped reading this nonsense, I hope you're well, it's so typical to talk about myself, I'm sorry. Did you ever manage to get out of this damn city? I didn't. No, I stayed here unfortunately, I stayed anchored in the past, the past that hurt me so much, the past that completely ruined my life. That's why I'm so bad, that's why I can't forget anything, that's why I don't trust anyone anymore. You're probably better off than me, you've probably moved on and are happy, enjoy that happiness thinking of me, I don't think we'll ever see each other again. In the end, they were right about love not always being what it seems, love mocked me, it was just a mirage to hurt me. At first, I thought it was a dream, that it was something sincere and special. I think love was the lake where we first met, the lake that tried to drown me and end my life. I don't have the strength to keep talking to you, I feel weak, I feel like it's the end, I'll always remember the special moments we lived, the life we shared together, I feel tears coming out of my eyes, now I have to embark on a new path, I hope to find happiness just like you. Goodbye Kris, I will always love you even though the light has gone out and there is only darkness. ❤❤️‍🔥🥺",thank adele creating monumental work matter many year go impossible forget song moved much make cry also inspired create story hello hoping talk nothing dont think change anything still remember good time hello still dont need tell important dont need tell mean thought could go far something wrong call innocence hello im darkness consuming soul even dont believe ill keep waiting hello hard answer question happened u im sure regret still feel thing everything complicated impossible move forward every day remember impossible forget hello cursed distance drove u apart fault fate still remember good time robbed u happiness hello cruel world deserve punishment perhaps ego led u wickedness god didnt want u didnt seek done thing right dont know else tell feel really bad right feel like everything breaking inside im suffocating ive forgotten breathe wish could burn like sardine right wish could explode thousand piece everyone would forget remember wrote hair infernal fire ember january burn hello hear im california dreaming used younger free much arrogance selfishness forgot felt feel world fell foot remember destiny mocked u remember world ignored u hope youre well there much difference u hello side shouldve called thousand time tell im sorry everything ive done call seems like youre never home hello outside least say ive tried tell im sorry breaking heart apologize ive already hurt much hope forgive hope youre happy move probably forgot youll remember something unpleasant toxic cant forget impossible youre like witch dagger stabbed heart destroyed everything like ghostfaces knife stabbed sidney scream there damn emptiness left void thats impossible fill remember bella said twilight love irrational love someone le sense everything make love love stupid bella also suffered lot edward think im feeling whole world falling apart inside twisting like there monster inside hello youve probably stopped reading nonsense hope youre well typical talk im sorry ever manage get damn city didnt stayed unfortunately stayed anchored past past hurt much past completely ruined life thats im bad thats cant forget anything thats dont trust anyone anymore youre probably better youve probably moved happy enjoy happiness thinking dont think well ever see end right love always seems love mocked mirage hurt first thought dream something sincere special think love lake first met lake tried drown end life dont strength keep talking feel weak feel like end ill always remember special moment lived life shared together feel tear coming eye embark new path hope find happiness like goodbye kris always love even though light gone darkness [UNK],NEGATIVE,0.9928885102272034,0,1

"[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if, after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

"ANGEL IN BLACK

Elegance,
passion,
art,
His voice rises to infinity and explodes:
the whole world admires her,
he adores her,
It is God who has sent us his majestic angel,
angel with a sweet and powerful voice.

He dresses in black,
she dresses in triumph,
She is dressed in immense love.

Everything is perfect in her,
everything combines:
her steps,
her gestures,
high and low tones,
the piano,
The chorus,
the violin,
Guitar,
and the wonderful effects in each presentation.

Her earrings and Saturn tattoo
They contain her musical force.
Angelo is the blessed name,
sacred tattoo on her right hand,
It is her divine love,
It is her eternal love.


She is unique in humility,
she is unique in interpretation:
heartache,
Sorrow of the soul,
pain and hope,
pain and dignity,
It is a cry that cries;
that she screams into space,
that claims,
who asks for forgiveness, but she also forgives...
and with the memories of deceptions and betrayals,
she also dances
she laughs too,
She interacts with the public respectful of her,
and everyone is now chanting and enjoying with elegance and rhythm.

This is Adele,
angel dressed in black,
glare,
childish and divine smile,
God's angel,
everyone's angel...
Adele, you are the heavenly gift to the universe,
Adele, long life and happiness in every step.

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

Are running out of time

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows)
Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

"The preeminent prominence of white dominance in this melodic promissory note from hell

like a self-induced abortion in a solitary room that booms with the mind-bending agony of this tortuous melody 
that makes a rush of serotonin happen like a search and rescue mission that exceeds the triage capacity of a million clinics
gospel truth that absolutely obliterates the senses - a ray of hope being snuffed out due to an unforeseen snapshot of what could have been had a trick question not cut the kite string of my hopes causing me to plumet from the summit with no bottom in sight as I continue falling faster into life-cancelling night",preeminent prominence white dominance melodic promissory note hell cause appreciation white genius eclipse dark contour love wishing well like sword damocles plunging embattled soul noon executed precision whose csection collapse sinkhole impassioned consciousness like dismal benediction like selfinduced abortion solitary room boom mindbending agony tortuous melody make rush serotonin happen like search rescue mission exceeds triage capacity million clinic gospel truth absolutely obliterates sens ray hope snuffed due unforeseen snapshot could trick question cut kite string hope causing plumet summit bottom sight continue falling faster lifecancelling night,NEGATIVE,0.9946435689926147,0,2

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore

Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

hello it's me
After all, I've been thinking about this for the past few years.
I wish I could overcome everything and meet you
They say time heals everything.
I'm not fully healed yet

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm still dreaming of the old days in California
When we were both young and free
I forgot how she felt before she took off.
We're already too different
Because we're so far apart

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, call out from the other side
I'm sure I've called you a thousand times already.
To tell you that I'm sorry for everything
Hello, I call you from outside
At least I can say I tried.
To tell you that I'm sorry for disappointing you
But that's enough, I'm not going to upset you anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret
That the both of us are running out of time

Hello, how are you doing?
This is just me talking about myself, sorry.
I hope you're doing well
Have you left that town yet?
From that town where nothing happens
That's completely understandable.
'Cause we don't have any time left

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside

"Hello
Adele

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)

When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

"I'm not really an Adele fan and I've never been interested in listening to any of her songs. But that cover about the flat earth piqued my interest.

The greatest compliment I can pay this song is that I kind of dislike Adele. I don't know why this amalgamation of various relationships failed but it was definitely her fault, she should definitely feel bad about it and I understand why she would want to run away from what she did. Whatever she did was bad.

I have a similar song I'm working on, but I'm a thousand times the bad person she is in this song. I can only hope to get across this level of emotion from my bad deeds in a rap, but I know I have to or the song won't work.",im really adele fan ive never interested listening song cover flat earth piqued interest greatest compliment pay song kind dislike adele dont know amalgamation various relationship failed definitely fault definitely feel bad understand would want run away whatever bad similar song im working im thousand time bad person song hope get across level emotion bad deed rap know song wont work,POSITIVE,0.9744954705238342,0,1

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

"Lyrics in Latin:

Nose to you:
After so many years I doubted - do you remember me?
I was reading by the mouth of the people
They say time heals everything
But I saw nothing

 

I write - do you read?
I turned to Pontus, dreaming, alas, what life was for me
When I was poor in Rome
I forget the bright life before, ah, the misery
Oh, how far you are from me
And my status

 

[chorus]

Greetings from Ovid
I live in poor Thomas
Repentance of all affections
But with you there is never mercy

 

Hello from exile
Alas, I have lost my wits
And if I could I would not have erred in you
But now it does not matter, I am cast down from hope.

 

Hello, Auguste
I always talk about myself, please forgive me
I hope you are well
What has become difficult with that daughter?
It is clear that we are both miserable
must be

 

[chorus]

Now greetings from Ovid
I live in poor Thomas
Repentance of all affections
But with you there is never mercy

And if I had been able I would have written nothing to Hercules
But I was condemned by the poem and by the mistake

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us

"OMG Adele is soooo amazing! I love her and her talent. Omg such masterpieces of songs! What beautiful, sad, inspiring music! Omg she is just best! Her music moves me in ways I can't explain! Adele iz such an inspiration! I feel better after crying over my abusive ex. She makes me understand I'm better than that! My ex sucks and if he ever touches me again, I'll make his cockadoodledoo bleed! Thank you, Adele, you are my one true love! I will find you and marry you, my talented butterfly! I'm sorry I'm writing so much, I have insomnia and get a bit gitty and pumped up, especially to ADELE'S gracious music. Love it, love it, love it! Omg her songs hit me metaphorically to how my ex's crippled self  hit me - only like in an opposite like way. He's a little short Mexican man that spreaded lies and lied about lying, lying that he lied a lie and continued to lie, lying like  the piece of 🟤 he is. He (almost) devoured anything good and worthy I have inside myself! He dwelled feelings in me like ugliness, powerlessness, unholy convictions, yielding a broken, careless, angry, guilty, bitter, disgusted little girl. I broke the patterns of forgiving and not forgetting, unemotional sex, ""good"" times and replaced them with just ME in moving along, healthy times and peace without any conflict. Omg love Adele and her ability to soothe my heart! PS, my adoptive Mom does the same and no longer speaks to me:(. Another birthday and holiday alone. Omg 😮. At least I have Adele and other people who sing songs.",omg adele soooo amazing love talent omg masterpiece song beautiful sad inspiring music omg best music move way cant explain adele iz inspiration feel better cry abusive ex make understand im better ex suck ever touch ill make cockadoodledoo bleed thank adele one true love find marry talented butterfly im sorry im writing much insomnia get bit gitty pumped especially adeles gracious music love love love omg song hit metaphorically ex crippled self hit like opposite like way he little short mexican man spreaded lie lied lying lying lied lie continued lie lying like piece [UNK] almost devoured anything good worthy inside dwelled feeling like ugliness powerlessness unholy conviction yielding broken careless angry guilty bitter disgusted little girl broke pattern forgiving forgetting unemotional sex good time replaced moving along healthy time peace without conflict omg love adele ability soothe heart p adoptive mom longer speaks another birthday holiday alone omg [UNK] least adele people sing song,NEGATIVE,0.9703329801559448,0,4

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)

MARK 14:51-52 
51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: 52 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. 

MARK 16:5-6 
5 When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a long white robe sitting on the right side; they were amazed and alarmed. 6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.

TITLE:  (SHOCKED BY HONOR)
                DON’T BE ALARMED!
HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIDE!

A anonymous young man couldn’t take the adversity that was gifted to him by following Jesus.
He fled leaving behind his garment.

At the resurrection of Jesus we find the same young man clothed in white linen.
Symbolic of purity the white linen represents the honor of overcoming.

A  juvenile overcomes adolescence when he gives honor.

He in the tomb allowed another to go ahead of him.
Jesus went on but he stayed.

Beloved they where shocked when they seen the young man in the tomb proclaiming 
‘It’s juvenile for you to seek the memory of death when the resurrection should be honored.

Can you hear the honor from what once was juvenile say
‘Jesus is not here, He’s moved on to maturity?

Jesus loves you so do I.

Your about to be SHOCKED BY HONOR!

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us

The Madonna is more of a pop singer. And he sings a lot too. I watched Mix a lot and her videos too. You are younger. But she still sings a lot. I also really liked DANASAMER. It was wonderful, but it was mediocre, right? But he had a spectacular voice. I liked watching it and I still watch it sometimes. MADONNA videos. I just didn't like one thing after learning how to translate conversations in Portuguese these days. And YouTube doesn't translate your songs into Portuguese. I think it's all of them, I don't know why. Then I'll listen to MADONNA's songs to see if it's like that too. Or just with yours.

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well

"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
